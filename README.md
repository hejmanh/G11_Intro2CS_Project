# RTOS Framework Project. G11 

This project is designed to follow the Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) framework. It consists of three main tasks, each implemented as a class. An object of each task is declared and added to the scheduler.

## Project Overview

1. **Task 1: Publish real time weather data to Adafruit IO server**
   - This task is responsible for fetching climate information from the OpenWeatherMap API and demonstrates how to publish data to IOT server. It shows the multitasking capabilities of the RTOS.

2. **Task 2: Disease Detection using AI Model**
   - Task 2 showcases the power of artificial intelligence by utilizing an AI model for disease detection. 

3. **Task 3: CNN Image Classification with PyTorch**
   - Task 3 focuses on computer vision and deep learning, using the PyTorch library to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying five different flower species based on images. This task demonstrates the application of deep learning in an RTOS environment.

You need to specify the correct dataset path and structure in the code to match your project's requirements. If you intend to run this code on a GPU, you'll also need GPU support and the CUDA toolkit installed to take full advantage of PyTorch's GPU acceleration capabilities.

3. Run the main file
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
