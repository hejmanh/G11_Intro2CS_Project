# RTOS Framework Project. G11 

This project is designed to follow the Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) framework. It consists of three main tasks, each implemented as a class. An object of each task is declared and added to the scheduler.

## Project Overview

1. **Task 1: Clone Climate Info from OpenWeatherMap**
   - This task is responsible for fetching climate information from the OpenWeatherMap API. It demonstrates how to use an API to collect weather data and showcases the multitasking capabilities of the RTOS.

2. **Task 2: Disease Detection using AI Model**
   - Task 2 showcases the power of artificial intelligence by utilizing an AI model for disease detection. 

3. **Task 3: Simple Hangman game** The project is a text-based Hangman game. It randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player has 10 attempts to guess the characters in the word. When a correct character is guessed, it is revealed in the word. If an incorrect character is guessed, the player loses a chance. The game continues until the player either guesses all the characters in the word or runs out of chances. After each guess, the user interface updates to display the current revealed characters and checks whether the game is over.
